							<p>First Robotics Competition is a high school program which gives students 6 weeks to design, build, and program a robot based on a new game given each year. It included, machining, 3d design (solidworks), wiring, Java programming, autonomous control, vision system.</p>
							<p>FRC is where I found my love for programming and robotics. I started in 2017 learning java programming and basic circuits and use of tools and design. In 2019 I was lead of the wiring team, programmer, and driver of the robot where we went to world championships in houston to compete. In 2020, despite having the season cut short from the Corona Virus I was head of the programming and wiring team. On wiring team I learned to solder, work with speed controller and micro controllers. I also worked with pneumatics with solenoids on gear shifters for our drive motors and pistons for different mechanisms</p>	
							<p>All the code was done in java, eclipse and vs code, using the robot base FRC provides. I designed and programmed vision systems for the robot to track parts of the field for the robot to autonomously pathfind to targets. This was done with endcoders on the drive base motors and pid's coded in to accurately and smoothly guide the robot to the target. I also programmed chain and rope-based elevators to move an arm to targeted heights.</p>
